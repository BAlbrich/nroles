NRoles is an experiment with roles in C#. Roles, very similar to traits, are high level constructs that promote better code reuse through easier composition. NRoles is a post-compiler created with [Mono.Cecil](http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil) that transforms an assembly to enable roles and compositions.
